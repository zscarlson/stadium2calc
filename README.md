I’m Zach and this is my Pokemon Stadium 2 calculator!!!!! For now it’s just for Little Cup Round 1. Here are my plans moving forward:

1. Add all opponents’ pokemon from Little Cup Round 1
2. Rework variant attack base power interface
3. Make it all look pretty
4. Maybe display damage rolls or chances somehow?
5. Duplicate it for Round 2 and just change the opponents
6. Publish
7. Repeat for Prime Cup/Poke Cup/Gym Lead Castle
