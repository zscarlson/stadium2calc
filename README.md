I’m Zach and this is my Pokemon Stadium 2 calculator!!!!! For now it’s just for Little Cup Round 1. Here are my plans moving forward:

1. Add third move functionality
2. Add all opponents’ pokemon from Little Cup Round 1
3. System dialogue prompting the user for base power for:
    - Rollout (Voltorb, Geodude, Rhyhorn, Marill, Togepi)
    - Flail (Phanpy, Chinchou, Magikarp)
    - Fury Cutter (Sentret)
    - Magnitude (Diglett)
    - Reversal (n/a)
4. Make it all look pretty
5. Maybe display damage rolls or chances somehow?
6. Duplicate it for Round 2 and just change the opponents
7. Publish
8. Repeat for Prime Cup/Poke Cup/Gym Lead Castle
